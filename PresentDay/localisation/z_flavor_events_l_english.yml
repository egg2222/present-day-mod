 NEB_PIPELINE_EVENT_ONE_TITLE:0 "Keystone XL Pipeline"
 NEB_PIPELINE_EVENT_ONE_DESC:0 "The Keystone XL Pipeline is an extension to the Keystone pipeline. Keystone XL was originally proposed in 2008, being approved in 2010 by the Canadian National Energy Board. The pipeline was very controversial, as it passed over the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer, both in Nebraska. On Feburary 24, 2015, President Obama vetoed the pipeline, with Senate being unable to override the veto. Now that the US is split up, what is your choice?"
 NEB_PIPELINE_P1_OP1:0 "Veto the pipeline, as it is a danger to the environment."
 NEB_PIPELINE_P1_OP2:0 "Allow the pipeline. An oil spill is unprobably, and we can clean it up if it happens."

 NORTH_IRELAND_EVENT_ONE_DESC:0 "The Republic of Ireland claims to be the rightful owner of North Ireland. However, North Ireland has been a part of our nation for hundreds of years. We could cede what is rightfully ours to them, or we could just keep it and deal with the rebels."
