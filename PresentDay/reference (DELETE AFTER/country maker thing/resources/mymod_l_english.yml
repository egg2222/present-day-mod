l_english:
 TAG: "The Name of your Country goes here"
 TAG_ADJ: "The adjusted Name of your Country goes here"

 # change 'TAG' to the Tag for your country and the content between the " " into the name of your country and the adjusted name
 # after you changed the values, save this file and put it into the localisation folder in your mymod folder 
 # it will only work in the english version, so if your game is German, change 'l_english' to 'l_german' and 'mymod_l_english.yml'
 # to 'mymod_l_german.yml'.
