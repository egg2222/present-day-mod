============================================== estier's Country Creator v1.0 ==============================================

First of thanks for downloading my program. I spent quite some time on it and hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Of course it is
not perfect and could use some more customisation, but that might come with time. 

================================================= How does this start? ====================================================

Extract the zip into a folder and click on the CountryCreator.jar

================================================== The different tabs =====================================================

1) COUNTRY 

In the Country-Tab you are able to chose the Tag of your country, the name of your country, as well as the adjusted Name of your 
country. The adjusted name of your country is used if you conquer a region far away from your main region. So if Poland invaded 
France, the adjusted name would be 'Polish France'. You can use the 'Check Availability' Tag to make sure your tag is not already
taken by a default country. For example X01 is not taken, the tag doesn't really matter that much though. 

2) COUNTRY ATTRIBUTES

2a)This is the tab with the most content. A lot of drop down boxes which are there for an easier use. Culture sets how your units look
(Western, Easter, Inuit...) and Primary Culture sets the primary culture of your state. Religion sets the religion of your state,
which does not change the religion of the provinces. Government sets the type of government that your country has and the rank
sets the rank of your government. Leave it to 1 if you don't want to bother with that. Technology group sets the technology 
available to you. Mercanilism needs a number in the field. If you fill in a string the country will be fucked up.

2b) Provinces are important so I created 2b for this. The drop down menu for provinces contains all provinces that are available
in EU4. The list is ordered in a way that 1 is followed by 10, and 10 is followed by 100. But you can search for the number of a
province by clikcing on the tab and then just typing e.g '86' on your keyboard for province number 86 (Münster). A list of the 
province IDs can be found either in the province folder in resources, or google 'EU4 province ID'. Owned provinces shows you
the provinces you already selected and enables you to remove unwanted ones. The capital drop down menu is used for selecting a 
capital for your country. The country selected will be the capital. Tick 'Fixed Capital' to set it as a fixed capital. Meaning 
you can't move your capital in game. 

2c) Monarch names are first names, leader names are last names. Ship names are the names of individual ships, army names are 
names of armies followed by the name of the province they were created in. Fleet names are the names of fleets.  

3) COLOR

This tab is used to chose a color for your nation. 

4) CREATE MOD 

After pressing the 'Create Mod' button, the mod will be created in your EU4 mod folder. C:/User/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod
It will also open the 'mymod_l_english.yml' file in which you have to change TAG to your chosen Tag and insert your country's name
and adjusted name. After that put the 'mymod_l_english.yml' file ino C:/User/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/my_mod/localisation


====================================================== After creating the mod =====================================================

Start up the game, enable the mod and play! :D You will have to manually add a flag. I recommend using flagmaker 2.0.1 
The resolution required for EU4 is 128x128. Then simply use gimp or another software and save the flag as a Your Tag.tga file and but it into
C:/User/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/my_mod/gfx/flags/ 
(Your Tag has to be the tag of your country)

====================================================== Did you know? ==============================================================

Bees make 'whoop whoop' when they bump into each other. You can look it up on YouTube. If you are too lazy to look it up on YouTube,
use this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U05VXQRFhns (I don't promote them or anything, it is just the first video that appears
if you search 'bees whoop whoop' on youtube).
